# fetch-api-javascript
<p>This project focusses on working with async functions &amp; fetch methods to retrieve data from an API.</p>

## Fetch API:

* The web page displays three random Chuck Norris jokes with the use of a fetch method and an API to retrieve the jokes.
* The web page also displays the current time and it is updated every second.
<hr/>

## Display of page:
<img src="pageView.JPG" alt="view of web page">
<hr/>

## Use of code:
<p>Open the file with the .html extention in the browser of your choice to view the web page.</p>
<p>To view or edit the code, I'd suggest opening the project folder in a text editor like Sublime Text or Visual Studio Code.</p>
<p>I hope that my code can potentially help you with your future projects.</p>
